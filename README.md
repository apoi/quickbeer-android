Running the project
-------------------

* You will need your own API key for the RateBeer service, as the keys can't be distributed. Place the key in format `ratebeer.api.key=KEY` to file `app/ratebeer-api.properties`.
* The project depends on an up-to-date version of [Reark](https://github.com/reark/reark) to be checked out in a sibling directory.

In other aspects the project should run out of the box with Android Studio. Let me know if there are any issues!
