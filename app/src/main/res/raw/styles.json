IBUs will typically range in the 20&rsquo;s, and lagering times will typically be 4-6 weeks, more in line with what pilsners have. Overall accent will be malty-to-balanced, alcohol in a slightly tighter range than either Pale Lager or Pilsner (4.5-5.5%). Most often the product of a microbrewery or brewpub, but macrobreweries can make this style if they jack up the hops a bit and make it all-malt.103",

The wild yeasts not only ferment and sour the beer, but they bring the funky, unpredictable flavours that characterize all lambic beers.

Up to a quarter of the alcohol in a Honjozo can be derived from pure ethanol. Honjozo sakes must use rice that has a seimaibuai &#40rice polishing rate&#41 of at least 70%. This means the outside 30% of the rice has been gently polished away. Usually lighter bodied than Junmai and can be served chilled, at room temperature, or above. Aside from the economic reason for adding alcohol, the aroma compounds present in the fermentation mash are highly alcohol soluble, so more aroma is possibly extracted. To contrast this though the flavor of the sake has been effectively diluted with the ethanol addition.",

Beers using the designation Scotch Ale are popular in the USA where most examples are brewed locally.

Overall accent will be malty-to-balanced, alcohol in a slightly tighter range than either Pale Lager or Pilsner (4.5-5.5%).

    "BeerStyleDescription": "Sour wheat beers were common in many parts of medieval and early Industrial Europe. Two styles – lambic and Berliner weisse – survived, but many others did not. Gose and Lichtenhainer are historic styles of sour wheat beer. Grodzisk is sometimes tart, sometimes not. Gose is seasoned with salt, Grodziskie and Lichtenhainer contain smoked malt. Historical sources are mixed about Lichtenhainer containing wheat, so modern interpretations may vary. Grätzer is an alternative name for Grodziskie. All three will be relatively low alcohol, with a strong wheat character, but will be distinct from classic examples of Berliner Weisse or lambic. As all we have are historical recreations, substantial differences may exist between interpretations.",
